        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Nikita Doronin. I started programming in my early teens and
          since then I've been building different tools, backend services and
          other practical applications. I'm currently a Computer Science student
          at the Moscow Polytechnical University, specializing in system
          programming - which is my favorite area of IT.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past 3+ years I studied and took a variety of courses on
          programming languages, technologies, and areas of the IT field. In the
          recent years I have also participated in national olympiads and IT
          competitions, and various conferences where I presented different
          projects. I am primarily interested in low-level programming,
          including the development of drivers, operating systems, and embedded
          systems. Additionally, I have a strong interest in backend and desktop
          application development. I write code to solve real problems and learn
          new concepts. Currently, my main languages are Java, Rust and C++.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm most proficient in Java: having completed numerous online courses
          and worked on several personal projects using this language. I have
          hands-on experience with the Spring Boot framework and its ecosystem.
          I am comfortable working with build tools such as Gradle and Maven. In
          addition, I have knowledge of working with SQL (PostgreSQL), as well
          as REST APIs and the HTTP(s) protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rust is another language I use extensively, with most of my recent
          projects developed in it. I have studied Rust both through online
          courses and the official documentation. I'm familiar with most of the
          language's features, including multihreading and asynchronous
          programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also work with C++, mainly driven by my interest in low-level
          development. While my experience in C++ is slightly less extensive
          than in Java and Rust, I have worked with the Windows API, GCC, and
          MSVC compilers. I have good experience of writing Makefiles and
          handling the compilation and linking process. Because of my interest
          in low-level systems, I have a goal of becoming an advanced C++
          developer and further improving my skills in this direction.
